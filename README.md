# Temperature Controlled DC Fan Using Arduino

## Overview
This project involves building a **Temperature Controlled DC Fan** using an **Arduino** microcontroller. The fan speed is regulated based on the ambient temperature measured by a temperature sensor (LM35). The system uses **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** to control the fan's speed, ensuring efficient cooling.

## Features
- **Temperature Sensing**: Uses **LM35** temperature sensor to measure the ambient temperature.
- **Fan Control**: A **DC fan** is controlled based on the temperature, with speed adjustments via **PWM**.
- **Real-time Display**: The current temperature is displayed on a **16x2 LCD** screen.
- **Efficient Cooling**: The fan speed automatically adjusts to keep the environment within a specific temperature range.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno** (or any compatible Arduino board)
- **LM35** Temperature Sensor
- **DC Fan**
- **MOSFET** (for controlling the fan)
- **16x2 LCD Display**
- **NPN Transistor or Relay**
- **Resistors, Jumper Wires, Breadboard**
